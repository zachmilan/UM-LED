UM-LED is a remote-controlled LED display in the shape of the University of Michiganâ€™s Block-M, paired with a custom handheld remote. Designed to resemble a polished consumer product, it features adjustable brightness, multiple LED modes, auto-dimming, haptic feedback, and rechargeable batteries.

## System Overview

- **LED Display** â€“ Block-M configuration of individually controlled through-hole LEDs, capable of multiple patterns with adjustable brightness.  
- **Remote Control** â€“ Handheld controller with capacitive-touch brightness slider, tactile buttons, haptic feedback, and status indicators.  
- **Core Features** â€“ BLE wireless control, auto-dimming via ambient light sensing, battery level indicators, power usage logging to microSD, and rechargeable Li-ion power systems.  

## Development

This repository will contain the complete project: hardware design files, embedded firmware, and supporting documentation. Estimated completion date: October 31, 2025.

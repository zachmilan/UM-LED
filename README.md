# UM-LED

UM-LED is a personal embedded systems project that I am currently developing. The main idea is to build a cool remote control LED display for my desk. This will be done by designing two PCB's (the remote and the display) and writing the firmware for each. 

As of now, the remote is fully assembled and I am nearing completion for the remote's firmware. Soldering was done using a hot-plate/stencil as well as by hand for through hole parts. Luckily the first version of the board is working as intended (after a bit of rework and debugging). 

The remote has some cool features - capacitive touch pads (to be used for brightness control), an accelerometer which wakes the remote when picked up, and a haptic motor for clear user feedback.  

My next step is to finish the remote firmware and then to design the schematic for the LED display (which will, in theory, be quicker than the remote).

I wrote a full, more formal design proposal when beginning this project (which I likely spent too much time on) - see [UM-LED Design Proposal (PDF)](docs/UM-LED%20Design%20Proposal.pdf). The main idea is still intact though it may not reflect the full design once done (for example, the accelerometer was an afterthought and hence is not included in the proposal.)

Below are some photos of the assembled remote:
